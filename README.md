# KnightsDilemma

The goal of this project is to find the shortest route for 'knight' on a chessboard.
The knight can only move in L shape ( 2 moves forward and one sideways; illustrated in the image below)

We need to find the least number of legal moves it takes for the knight to reach from point A to B on a chessboard.
This is the variation of Shortest Path Problem.


#Objective

Creating a visual representation of knight's movement on the chessboard
Make sure knight doesn't go off board.

#Method

Using SFML library to create the GUI.
Driver code in C++.
